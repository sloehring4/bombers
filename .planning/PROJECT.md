# O'Fallon Bombers Baseball Website

## What This Is

A redesigned website for the O'Fallon Bombers, a select youth baseball club in O'Fallon, Illinois (ages 7U–15U). The site replaces a cluttered, outdated JerseyWatch-hosted site with a clean, sporty, simplified design that non-technical board members can easily update. Keeps costs free or minimal.

## Core Value

Parents and families can quickly find team rosters, season fees/events, spirit wear, and contact info — without navigating a cluttered site.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Clean, modern design with bold gold (#feda00) and dark purple (#0a0047) branding
- [ ] Team rosters by age group (7U–15U)
- [ ] Season fees and events information
- [ ] Spirit wear section (link or embedded store)
- [ ] Contact form and signup/registration info
- [ ] Easy content management for non-technical board members
- [ ] Free or minimal-cost hosting
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout
- [ ] Simplified navigation — fewer pages, less clutter

### Out of Scope

- Real-time game scores or live updates — complexity not justified for a community org site
- Player stats/analytics — not needed for a youth select club site
- Online payment processing — keep it simple, link out if needed
- Member login/accounts — no gated content needed
- Blog/news system — Bombers Blast newsletter handled externally

## Context

- Current site: https://www.ofallonbombers.com/ (JerseyWatch platform)
- Club competes in SISBL and SWIBL leagues
- Current site has 16+ roster pages across age groups, plus pages for fees, spirit wear, code of conduct, pillars of sportsmanship, board of directors, player development director, links, contact, and donations
- Pain points: cluttered layout, outdated visual style
- All four core sections (rosters, fees/events, spirit wear, contact) are heavily used by families
- Board members (non-technical volunteers) will maintain content
- Contact email: ofallonbombers@gmail.com
- Social: Facebook and Instagram presence

## Constraints

- **Budget**: Free or minimal hosting costs — rules out paid CMS platforms
- **Maintainers**: Non-technical board members — needs simple content editing (no code changes to update rosters/events)
- **Branding**: Gold (#feda00) and dark purple (#0a0047) — established team colors, must keep
- **Design**: Clean & sporty feel — bold typography, athletic energy, lots of whitespace

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Simplified site structure | Current site has too many pages and feels cluttered | — Pending |
| Keep gold/purple brand colors | Established Bombers identity | — Pending |
| Non-technical CMS approach | Board members need to update without coding | — Pending |
| Free/minimal hosting | Community org budget constraints | — Pending |
