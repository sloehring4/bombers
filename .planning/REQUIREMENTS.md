## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Online payment processing | Liability, PCI compliance — registration payments handled by JerseyWatch |
| Member login/accounts | No gated content needed |
| Team chat/messaging | Use existing tools (GroupMe, team apps) |
| Blog/news system | Newsletter handled externally |
| Live game scores | Requires real-time updates nobody will maintain |
| Player stats/analytics | Overkill for youth select club, high maintenance |
