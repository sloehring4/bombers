  <name>Task 1: Create spirit wear data file and display components</name>
  <files>
    src/lib/data/spirit-wear.ts
    src/components/spirit-wear/ProductCard.tsx
    src/components/spirit-wear/ProductGrid.tsx
    public/images/spirit-wear/placeholder.jpg
  </files>
  <action>
**1. Create placeholder image:**
Copy `public/images/sponsors/placeholder.jpg` to `public/images/spirit-wear/placeholder.jpg` for product image placeholders.

**2. Create `src/lib/data/spirit-wear.ts`** following the centralized data file pattern (see sponsors.ts, fees.ts):

Define the `SpiritWearProduct` interface:
- id: string (kebab-case identifier)
- name: string (display name)
- description: string (1-2 sentence description)
- price: number (USD, whole dollars)
- imageUrl: string (path to product image)
- category: 'apparel' | 'accessories' | 'headwear'
- sizes?: readonly string[] (optional size options)
- externalUrl?: string (optional specific product page URL)

Export `SPIRIT_WEAR_STORE_URL` constant: `'https://example-spirit-wear-store.com'` (placeholder, easy to update later).

Export `spiritWearProducts` as readonly array with 6-8 products covering these categories:
- **Apparel (4 items):** Bombers T-Shirt ($20, Youth S-Adult XL), Bombers Hoodie ($40, Youth S-Adult XL), Bombers Jersey ($35, Youth S-Adult XL), Bombers Shorts ($25, Youth S-Adult L)
- **Headwear (2 items):** Bombers Baseball Cap ($18), Bombers Visor ($15)
- **Accessories (2 items):** Bombers Water Bottle ($12), Bombers Equipment Bag ($30)

All products should use `'/images/spirit-wear/placeholder.jpg'` as their imageUrl. Use `as const` on exported arrays for readonly typing.

**3. Create `src/components/spirit-wear/ProductCard.tsx`** (server component, no 'use client'):
- Props: `product: SpiritWearProduct` and `storeUrl: string`
- Layout: bg-white rounded-lg border-2 border-gray-200 hover:border-bombers-yellow hover:shadow-lg transition-all
- Image section: relative h-48 bg-gray-50 with Next.js Image component (width={300}, height={200}, object-cover, rounded-t-lg, sizes responsive)
- Content section (p-6):
  - Category badge: small pill above name (bg-bombers-navy/10 text-bombers-navy text-xs px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full uppercase tracking-wide)
  - Product name as h3 (text-lg font-bold text-bombers-navy mb-2)
  - Description (text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4)
  - Price and buy button row (flex items-center justify-between):
    - Price: text-xl font-bold text-bombers-navy, formatted as "$XX"
    - Buy Now link: `<a>` to `product.externalUrl || storeUrl`, target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer", styled as inline-flex items-center gap-1 bg-bombers-yellow text-bombers-navy px-4 py-2 rounded font-semibold text-sm hover:bg-bombers-yellow/90 transition-colors
    - Include ExternalLink icon from lucide-react (w-4 h-4, aria-hidden="true") inside the link
  - Optional sizes display: if product.sizes exists, show "Sizes: Youth S, Youth M, ..." in text-xs text-gray-500 mt-3

**4. Create `src/components/spirit-wear/ProductGrid.tsx`** (server component, no 'use client'):
- Props: `products: readonly SpiritWearProduct[]` and `storeUrl: string`
- Layout: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6
- Map over products rendering ProductCard for each, passing product and storeUrl

  <done>spirit-wear.ts exports SpiritWearProduct interface, SPIRIT_WEAR_STORE_URL constant, and spiritWearProducts array with 6-8 products.

  <name>Task 2: Compose Spirit Wear page at /spirit-wear</name>
  <files>src/app/spirit-wear/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/app/spirit-wear/page.tsx` following the page composition pattern from sponsors/page.tsx and fees/page.tsx.

**Page structure:**

1. **Metadata export** (Next.js static metadata):
   - title: "Spirit Wear | O'Fallon Bombers"
   - description: "Shop official O'Fallon Bombers apparel, accessories, and team gear."

2. **Page header** (centered, mb-12):
   - h1: "Spirit Wear" (text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-bombers-navy mb-4)
   - Subtitle paragraph: "Show your Bombers pride with official team apparel and accessories." (text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto)

3. **Product catalog section** (mb-16):
   - Section heading: "Available Products" with yellow bottom border accent (text-2xl font-semibold text-bombers-navy mb-6 border-b-4 border-bombers-yellow pb-2 inline-block)
   - Render ProductGrid with spiritWearProducts and SPIRIT_WEAR_STORE_URL

4. **Store CTA section** (prominent call-to-action):
   - Container: bg-bombers-navy text-white rounded-lg p-8 md:p-12 text-center
   - h2: "Visit Our Store" (text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-4)
   - Description paragraph: "Browse our complete catalog and make purchases through our secure online store." (text-lg mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto)
   - CTA link to SPIRIT_WEAR_STORE_URL: inline-block bg-bombers-yellow text-bombers-navy px-8 py-3 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-bombers-yellow/90 transition-colors, text "Shop All Products", target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

**Layout wrapper:** main element with className "container mx-auto px-4 py-8 md:py-12" (matching fees page pattern).

This is a server component (no 'use client' directive) - all data is static, no interactivity needed.
