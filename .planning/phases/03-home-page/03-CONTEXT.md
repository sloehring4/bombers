# Phase 3: Home Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Landing page that gives parents quick access to the most-used sections (Teams, Fees, Spirit Wear, Contact) while communicating Bombers branding with athletic energy. This is the home page only — individual content pages are built in later phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero section
- Full-width background photo style — bold, immersive sports-site feel
- Placeholder image for now (real team action photo swapped in later)
- Headline focused on team identity: "O'Fallon Bombers" front and center
- Include a tagline/motto subheadline under the team name (Claude writes something fitting)

### Quick links layout
- Icon cards — each card has an icon, title, and short description
- Scannable grid layout for Teams, Fees, Spirit Wear, Contact (and possibly more)

### Key info display
- Show all key dates: next tryout date, registration deadline, season start date
- Displayed as an announcement banner/strip across the page — eye-catching, can't miss it

### Overall page feel
- Mix of bold/sporty and clean/professional — sporty energy in the hero, clean and structured in content sections below
- Minimal page structure: hero + quick links + key dates banner — no extra sections
- No specific reference site — just make it look good

### Claude's Discretion
- Number and selection of CTA buttons in hero
- Hero overlay approach (dark overlay vs gradient) for text readability
- Hero height (full viewport vs partial)
- Whether Bombers logo appears in hero area (separate from header)
- Quick link card count and which sections to include
- Quick link card hover effects
- Quick links placement relative to hero (directly after vs after intro)
- Announcement banner placement (above hero vs between hero and content)
- Whether key dates come from JSON data file or hardcoded initially
- Banner display mode (all dates at once vs rotating)
- Section separation style (alternating backgrounds vs seamless flow)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. User wants Bombers identity front and center with a tagline that captures team spirit.
