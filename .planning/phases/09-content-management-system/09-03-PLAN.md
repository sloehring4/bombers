<objective>
Create a comprehensive Content Update Guide that non-technical board members can follow to edit site content.

Purpose: The JSON files and validation pipeline are useless if board members don't know how to use them. This guide is the bridge between technical infrastructure (JSON, GitHub, Zod) and non-technical users (board members comfortable with email but not code). Quality of this document directly determines whether the CMS phase succeeds.

Output: A single, thorough markdown document at docs/CONTENT-UPDATE-GUIDE.md covering all data types, the GitHub editing workflow, validation, preview, and troubleshooting.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the Content Update Guide</name>
  <files>
    docs/CONTENT-UPDATE-GUIDE.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Create `docs/CONTENT-UPDATE-GUIDE.md` with the following structure. Write for someone comfortable with email and basic web browsing but with NO coding, GitHub, or JSON experience. Avoid technical jargon — when unavoidable, define terms inline.

    **Document structure:**

    ## 1. Welcome / Overview
    - What this guide is for (updating website content: rosters, events, fees, sponsors, etc.)
    - What you need: GitHub account, repository access, web browser
    - Safety features summary: automatic validation catches errors, preview lets you check before publishing, instant rollback if something goes wrong
    - Contact placeholder: [TECHNICAL_CONTACT] for help (to be filled in by the team)

    ## 2. Getting Started with GitHub
    - What GitHub is (in plain English: "a website that stores the files for the Bombers website")
    - How to sign in
    - How to navigate to the bombers repository
    - How to find the data files (src > lib > data folder)
    - Brief orientation: "Each .json file contains one type of content"

    ## 3. How to Edit a File (General Process)
    Step-by-step the GitHub web editor workflow:
    1. Navigate to the file
    2. Click the pencil (edit) icon
    3. Make changes in the editor
    4. Scroll down, write a short description of what you changed
    5. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
    6. Click "Propose changes"
    7. On the next page, click "Create pull request"
    8. Wait 1-2 minutes for the green checkmark (validation passed) or red X (error found)
    9. If green: click "Merge pull request" then "Confirm merge"
    10. Changes go live in 2-3 minutes

    Explain each step in plain language. Describe what the user will see on screen.

    ## 4. Editing Team Rosters (teams.json)
    - File location: src/lib/data/teams.json
    - Common tasks with copy-paste templates:
      - **Add a player**: Show exact JSON snippet to copy, explain where to paste it (inside the "players" array of the correct team), remind about commas
      - **Remove a player**: Explain how to delete the player block and handle the comma
      - **Change a jersey number**: Find the player, change the number
      - **Add a new team**: Full template with all required fields
      - **Update a coach**: Change name, bio, photo reference
      - **Update the current season**: Change the "currentSeason" value at the top

    ## 5. Editing Fees & Events (fees.json)
    - Common tasks with templates:
      - **Update a fee amount**: Find the age group, change the numbers
      - **Add a new age group fee**: Full template
      - **Change an event date**: Find the event by label, update date string
      - **Add a new event**: Full template with category options explained
      - **Update FAQ answers**: Find the question, edit the answer text
      - **Add a new FAQ**: Full template with category options

    ## 6. Editing Board Members & Staff (organization.json)
    - Common tasks with templates:
      - **Add a board member**: Full template
      - **Update a member's title or bio**: Find by name, edit
      - **Remove a board member**: Delete the block

    ## 7. Editing Sponsors (sponsors.json)
    - Common tasks with templates:
      - **Add a new sponsor**: Full template (id, name, logoUrl, description, websiteUrl)
      - **Remove a sponsor**: Delete the block
      - **Update sponsor info**: Find by name, edit fields

    ## 8. Editing Spirit Wear (spirit-wear.json)
    - Common tasks with templates:
      - **Add a product**: Full template with category options
      - **Update price**: Find product, change price
      - **Update store URL**: Change storeUrl at top of file

    ## 9. Editing Home Page Content (home.json)
    - Common tasks:
      - **Change hero headline or tagline**
      - **Update key dates on homepage**
      - **Update quick link descriptions**
    - Note: Icon assignments (Users, DollarSign, etc.) are managed in code — contact [TECHNICAL_CONTACT] to change icons

    ## 10. Editing Contact Info (contact.json)
    - Common tasks:
      - **Update email address**
      - **Update donation URL**
      - **Change social media URLs**
    - Note: Social media icon types are managed in code

    ## 11. Editing Code of Conduct (conduct.json)
    - Common tasks:
      - **Edit rules in a section**
      - **Add a new conduct section**

    ## 12. Uploading Images
    - Step-by-step for uploading via GitHub web UI
    - Image naming rules: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., "coach-mike-adams.jpg")
    - Where to upload each type: /public/images/teams/, /public/images/coaches/, /public/images/sponsors/, /public/images/board/
    - Recommended sizes (team photos: 1200x800, headshots: 400x400, logos: 800x800 transparent PNG preferred)
    - How to reference the image in JSON (the path starts with /images/ not /public/images/)

    ## 13. Previewing Your Changes
    - After creating a pull request, Vercel automatically creates a preview
    - Look for the Vercel bot comment with a preview link
    - Click the link to see your changes before publishing
    - Note: Preview setup happens in Phase 10 (Deployment); this section describes what to expect

    ## 14. Troubleshooting
    - **"I see a red X on my pull request"**: Validation failed — common causes (missing comma, extra comma, missing quotes, invalid value). How to click "Files changed" to re-edit.
    - **"I can't find the edit button"**: Need repository access — contact [TECHNICAL_CONTACT]
    - **"My changes aren't showing on the website"**: Did you merge? Wait 2-3 min, try Ctrl+F5 refresh
    - **"I made a mistake and it's live"**: Contact [TECHNICAL_CONTACT] for instant rollback via Vercel
    - **"I see weird symbols like <<<< HEAD"**: Merge conflict — contact [TECHNICAL_CONTACT]
    - **"The editor looks different from the guide"**: GitHub updates their UI periodically — the steps are the same but buttons may look slightly different

    ## 15. JSON Quick Reference
    - Brief primer on JSON syntax rules: curly braces for objects, square brackets for arrays, commas between items (but NOT after the last item), all strings in double quotes, numbers without quotes
    - Common mistakes with visual examples showing wrong vs right
    - Tip: Copy an existing entry and modify it rather than writing from scratch

    ## 16. Getting Help
    - Primary contact: [TECHNICAL_CONTACT] — [TECHNICAL_CONTACT_EMAIL]
    - For urgent issues (site is broken): [TECHNICAL_CONTACT_PHONE]
    - How to create a GitHub Issue for non-urgent questions

    **Writing guidelines:**
    - Use numbered steps for all procedures
    - Use bold for UI elements ("Click **Propose changes**")
    - Include copy-paste JSON templates for every common operation
    - Use "WARNING" callouts for destructive operations (removing items, changing IDs)
    - Reference actual file paths from the project (src/lib/data/teams.json, not generic paths)
    - Use [SCREENSHOT: description] placeholders where screenshots would help (actual screenshots can be added later)
    - Use [TECHNICAL_CONTACT], [TECHNICAL_CONTACT_EMAIL], [TECHNICAL_CONTACT_PHONE] as placeholders throughout
