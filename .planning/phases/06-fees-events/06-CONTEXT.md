# Phase 6: Fees & Events - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Parents can find season costs, key dates, and registration information. The page presents fee breakdowns by age group, a calendar of key dates (tryouts, season start, tournaments), embedded JerseyWatch registration, and an FAQ section answering common parent questions. Content management tooling and deployment are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Fee presentation
- Fee organization structure (unified vs per-age-group) at Claude's discretion based on data
- Fee detail level (itemized breakdown vs simple totals) at Claude's discretion
- Layout style (pricing cards vs clean table) at Claude's discretion
- Payment-related details (plans, methods, financial aid) included at Claude's discretion

### Key dates layout
- Presentation format (timeline vs list vs calendar cards) at Claude's discretion
- Event types to include (milestones only vs comprehensive) at Claude's discretion
- Past event handling (greyed out vs hidden) at Claude's discretion
- Event categorization (grouped by type vs single chronological list) at Claude's discretion

### Registration flow
- Embed JerseyWatch registration form via iframe where possible, with link fallback if embedding not supported
- Urgency messaging approach (deadline callouts vs clean presentation) at Claude's discretion
- CTA placement (dedicated section vs integrated with fees vs both) at Claude's discretion
- Registration checklist (what parents need to prepare) at Claude's discretion

### FAQ structure
- Accordion format (expand/collapse) — user decision, not discretionary
- Question grouping (by topic vs flat list) at Claude's discretion
- FAQ content generated by Claude based on typical youth sports parent questions
- FAQ placement (same page vs separate) at Claude's discretion

### Claude's Discretion
- Fee organization, detail level, and layout style
- Key dates format, event types, past event handling, and categorization
- Registration urgency messaging, CTA placement, and checklist inclusion
- FAQ grouping, content generation, and page placement
- All technical implementation details

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Accordion for FAQ is required (not optional) — matches the existing Accordion component from Phase 5
- JerseyWatch embed preferred over link-out — parents should be able to register without leaving the site
- Reuse existing Accordion component built in Phase 5 for FAQ section
