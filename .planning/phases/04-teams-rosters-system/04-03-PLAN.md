<objective>
Close 3 verification gaps from Phase 04: (1) create missing placeholder images for coaches and teams, (2) add coach bio support per TEAM-04 requirement, (3) add 15U team to complete the 7U-15U age range.

Purpose: Phase 04 verification found blockers — missing image assets cause 404s, coach bios were never implemented despite TEAM-04 requiring them, and the age range stops at 14U instead of 15U per success criteria.
Output: All coach/team images load, bios display on coach cards, 15U team appears in data.

  <name>Task 1: Create placeholder images and add coach bios + 15U team to data</name>

  <action>
    **Create placeholder images:**
    1. Create directories: `public/images/coaches/` and `public/images/teams/`
    2. Generate simple placeholder images using a script or copy the existing `public/images/hero-placeholder.jpg` as a base. Each image should be a valid JPEG file (even a 1x1 pixel or small colored rectangle is fine — these are sample placeholders, not final photos).
    3. Create `public/images/coaches/placeholder.jpg` — a generic person silhouette placeholder
    4. Create `public/images/teams/7u-adams.jpg`, `9u-johnson.jpg`, `10u-smith.jpg`, `14u-patterson.jpg` — team photo placeholders

    For generating placeholders: Use Node.js to create minimal valid JPEG files, or copy the existing hero-placeholder.jpg to each location. The simplest approach is copying the existing placeholder since these are sample data anyway.

    **Add bio field to Coach interface:**
    In `src/lib/data/teams.ts`:
    1. Add `bio?: string` to the Coach interface (after `photoUrl`)
    2. Add sample bios to at least the head coaches (2-3 sentences each about coaching experience, philosophy, or background). Assistant coaches can optionally have bios too. Example bios:
       - "Coach Adams has been coaching youth baseball for 8 years and focuses on building fundamental skills in a fun, supportive environment."
       - Keep bios realistic and focused on coaching philosophy, years of experience, and development focus.

    **Add 15U team to data:**
    Add at least one 15U team to the `teams` array in teams.ts following the established pattern:
    - id: `15u-{coachLastName}` (lowercase)
    - name: `15U {CoachLastName}`
    - ageGroup: `15U`
    - Include 8-10 sample players with names and jersey numbers
    - Include 1-2 coaches with bios
    - teamPhotoUrl is optional (can be undefined)
    - Place after the 14U teams in the array

    **Privacy decision (per context):** Coach data remains privacy-first — no email/phone, link to contact page instead.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors
    - Verify files exist: `ls public/images/coaches/placeholder.jpg public/images/teams/7u-adams.jpg public/images/teams/9u-johnson.jpg public/images/teams/10u-smith.jpg public/images/teams/14u-patterson.jpg`
    - Verify 15U team in data: `grep "15U" src/lib/data/teams.ts`
    - Verify bio field: `grep "bio" src/lib/data/teams.ts`
  </verify>
  <done>
    - All 5 placeholder images exist as valid files in public/images/
    - Coach interface has `bio?: string` field
    - At least head coaches have sample bio strings
    - At least one 15U team exists in teams array with full roster data
    - TypeScript compiles with no errors
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Update CoachCard to display bios and verify build</name>
  <files>
    src/components/teams/CoachCard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Update the CoachCard component to display the optional bio field:

    1. In `src/components/teams/CoachCard.tsx`, add bio display below the role text:
       - Only render bio paragraph when `coach.bio` is truthy (conditional rendering)
       - Style: `text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2` — keep it subtle and readable
       - Bio text should appear below the coach's role in the info section
       - Keep existing styling/hover effects unchanged

    2. The component should go from:
       ```
       <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{coach.role}</p>
       ```
       To something like:
       ```
       <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{coach.role}</p>
       {coach.bio && (
         <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">{coach.bio}</p>
       )}
       ```

    3. Run full build to confirm everything works end-to-end:
       - `npm run build` should succeed
       - All team pages (including new 15U) should be listed in SSG output
       - No broken imports or type errors
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors
    - Run `npm run build` — build succeeds
    - Build output lists 15U team page(s) in pre-rendered routes
    - Grep CoachCard for "coach.bio" — bio rendering present
  </verify>
  <done>
    - CoachCard conditionally renders bio text when present
    - Build succeeds with all team pages pre-rendered (including 15U)
    - No TypeScript errors
    - TEAM-04 requirement (coach bios) is satisfied
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes — type safety maintained
2. `npm run build` succeeds — all pages pre-render including 15U team(s)
3. All placeholder images exist in public/images/ (coaches + teams)
4. Coach interface includes bio field, sample bios populated
5. CoachCard renders bio when present
6. At least one 15U team exists in data with full roster
7. No broken image references remain
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 3 verification gaps are closed:
  - Gap 1 (missing images): 5 placeholder images exist and will no longer 404
  - Gap 2 (coach bios): Coach interface has bio field, CoachCard displays it, sample bios populated
  - Gap 3 (age range): 15U team added, overview page will show 7U-15U range
- Build passes with no errors
- All existing functionality preserved (no regressions)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-teams-rosters-system/04-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
