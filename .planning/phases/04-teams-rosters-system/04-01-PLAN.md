<objective>
Create the teams data layer and overview page where parents can browse all Bombers teams grouped by age division.

Purpose: Establish the data foundation for all team/roster functionality and give parents an organized view of every team in the organization.
Output: Teams overview page at /teams with clickable team cards grouped by age, powered by a type-safe data file.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create team data types and sample data</name>
  <files>src/lib/data/teams.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/lib/data/teams.ts` following the same centralized data pattern as `src/lib/data/home.ts`.

Define and export these TypeScript interfaces:
- `Player`: `name: string`, `jerseyNumber: number`
- `Coach`: `name: string`, `role: 'Head Coach' | 'Assistant Coach'`, `photoUrl: string` (no email/phone — privacy-first per research recommendation, link to contact page instead)
- `Team`: `id: string` (URL slug like "10u-cook"), `name: string` (display like "10U Cook"), `ageGroup: string` ("7U", "10U", etc.), `headCoachName: string`, `season: string`, `players: Player[]`, `coaches: Coach[]`, `teamPhotoUrl?: string`

Export a `currentSeason` constant: `"Spring 2026"`

Export a `teams` array with sample data covering at least 4 age groups (e.g., 7U, 9U, 10U, 12U, 14U) with 8-10 total teams. Per user decision, teams use naming convention "age + coach last name" (e.g., "10U Cook", "10U Smith"). Include:
- Teams with full rosters (8-12 players each with realistic names and jersey numbers)
- At least one team with an empty players array (to test empty state)
- Each team with 1-2 coaches (Head Coach required, Assistant optional)
- Coach photos pointing to `/images/coaches/placeholder.jpg` (placeholder for now)
- A couple teams with `teamPhotoUrl` set, others without

Sort teams alphabetically by coach name within each age group in the data array.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no type errors. Verify the file exports Player, Coach, Team interfaces and teams array.</verify>
  <done>Type-safe teams data file exists with exported interfaces and sample data covering multiple age groups, including empty roster and missing photo cases.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build teams overview page with grouped layout</name>
  <files>src/components/teams/TeamCard.tsx, src/app/teams/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**TeamCard.tsx** — Create `src/components/teams/TeamCard.tsx`:
- Accept `team: Team` prop
- Render as a `Link` to `/teams/${team.id}` (import from next/link)
- Display team name prominently (e.g., "10U Cook") and head coach name below
- Show player count and coach count as summary stats
- Use `Users` icon from lucide-react (consistent with home page quick links)
- Apply group hover pattern (consistent with Phase 3): border color change to bombers-yellow, slight lift (-translate-y-1), shadow increase on hover
- Style with Tailwind: white bg, rounded-lg, border-2 border-gray-200, p-6
- Use bombers-navy for text, bombers-yellow accents on hover

**Teams overview page** — Create `src/app/teams/page.tsx`:
- Server Component (no "use client" needed)
- Import `teams` and `currentSeason` from `@/lib/data/teams`
- Group teams by `ageGroup` using `Array.reduce()` into `Record<string, Team[]>`
- Sort age groups numerically (parse int from "7U", "10U", etc.)
- Within each age group, teams already sorted in data file
- Page header: "Our Teams" as h1, season label (e.g., "Spring 2026 Rosters") as subtitle — season label should be prominent per user decision
- Each age group gets a section with h2 heading (e.g., "7U Division") with a yellow bottom border accent (border-b-4 border-bombers-yellow)
- Teams within each group displayed in responsive grid: 1 col mobile, 2 cols sm, 3 cols lg
- Use Container component pattern if it exists, otherwise use `container mx-auto px-4`
- Add `export const metadata` with title "Teams | O'Fallon Bombers" and appropriate description

Export metadata for SEO:
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Teams | O\'Fallon Bombers',
  description: 'Browse all O\'Fallon Bombers baseball teams by age group. View rosters, coaches, and team information for Spring 2026.',
};
```
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking. Run `npm run build` to confirm static page generates. Visit `/teams` in dev server to confirm page renders with grouped teams and clickable cards.</verify>
  <done>Teams overview page renders at /teams showing all teams grouped by age division with clickable cards. Season label is visible. Cards link to /teams/[teamId] (404 expected until Plan 02).</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- `npm run build` succeeds and generates /teams page
- Teams page shows age groups in ascending numerical order
- Each age group contains its teams in a responsive grid
- Team cards display team name, coach name, player/coach counts
- Team cards are clickable links to /teams/[teamId]
- Season label "Spring 2026 Rosters" appears prominently
- Empty-roster teams still appear on overview (with 0 players shown)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Parents visiting /teams see all Bombers teams organized by age group with a clear season label. Each team card is clickable and shows key info at a glance. The data layer supports the roster detail pages that Plan 02 will build.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-teams-rosters-system/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
