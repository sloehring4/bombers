<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: About and Board/Staff pages</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx, src/app/board-staff/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**src/app/about/page.tsx** (Server Component):
- Export `metadata` with title "About Us | O'Fallon Bombers" and descriptive SEO description
- Page structure with `container mx-auto px-4 max-w-4xl` wrapper, `py-8 md:py-12` padding
- Page header: h1 "About the O'Fallon Bombers" with subtitle
- Four content sections, each with h2 heading and prose text:
  1. **Our Mission** — Developing well-rounded young athletes through competitive baseball, emphasizing skill development, teamwork, sportsmanship, character building
  2. **Our History** — Founded in O'Fallon, grown from small group of families into premier youth baseball org, teams across 7U through 15U age divisions
  3. **Organization Structure** — Volunteer Board of Directors oversees operations, background-checked coaching staff. Include a callout box (yellow border-l-4 with link to /board-staff page)
  4. **Our Values** — 2x2 grid of value cards (Excellence, Teamwork, Character, Community) with `bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6`
- Match existing page styling patterns from teams pages

**src/app/board-staff/page.tsx** (Server Component):
- Export `metadata` with title "Board & Staff | O'Fallon Bombers"
- Import `boardMembers` and `staff` from `@/lib/data/organization`
- Import `BoardMemberCard` from `@/components/organization/BoardMemberCard`
- Page header: centered h1 "Board & Staff" with subtitle about volunteer leadership
- **Board of Directors section:** h2 with `border-b-4 border-bombers-yellow` underline, responsive card grid `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`, map boardMembers to BoardMemberCard
- **Staff section:** Conditionally rendered only if `staff.length > 0` (same grid pattern)
- **Contact CTA:** Bottom card with "Questions or Feedback?" heading, link to /contact page with yellow button
- Privacy-first: NO contact info on the page per user decision — the CTA links to contact page
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit`. Verify both routes resolve by checking file existence at correct paths.</verify>
  <done>About page has mission/history/structure/values sections. Board/Staff page renders board members in card grid with privacy-first approach and contact CTA.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Code of Conduct, Sponsors pages, home sponsors section, and navigation update</name>
  <files>src/app/code-of-conduct/page.tsx, src/app/sponsors/page.tsx, src/components/home/SponsorsSection.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/lib/navigation.ts</files>
  <action>
**src/app/code-of-conduct/page.tsx** (Server Component):
- Export `metadata` with title "Code of Conduct | O'Fallon Bombers"
- Import `Accordion` from `@/components/organization/Accordion`
- Import `conductSections` from `@/lib/data/conduct`
- Page header: h1 "Code of Conduct" with subtitle
- Values intro block: yellow border-l-4 callout with 2-3 sentences about positive, respectful environment (per Claude's discretion to include values intro)
- Transform `conductSections` into accordion items: map each section to `{ id, title, content: <ul> of rules }` where each rule is an `<li>` with yellow bullet and gray text
- Render `<Accordion items={accordionItems} />`
- Enforcement notice at bottom: gray card with h2 "Enforcement" and brief policy on violations

**src/app/sponsors/page.tsx** (Server Component):
- Export `metadata` with title "Our Sponsors | O'Fallon Bombers"
- Import `SponsorGrid` from `@/components/organization/SponsorGrid`
- Import `sponsors` from `@/lib/data/sponsors`
- Page header: centered h1 "Our Sponsors" with subtitle
- Full sponsor grid: `<SponsorGrid sponsors={sponsors} />` (no limit, show all)
- "Become a Sponsor" CTA section at bottom: navy background (`bg-bombers-navy text-white rounded-lg p-8 md:p-12 text-center`) with h2, description paragraph, yellow button linking to /contact

**src/components/home/SponsorsSection.tsx** (Server Component):
- Import `SponsorGrid` from `@/components/organization/SponsorGrid`
- Import `sponsors` from `@/lib/data/sponsors`
- Import `Link` from `next/link`
- Section with `py-12 md:py-16 bg-gray-50` background
- Centered section header: h2 "Our Sponsors" with subtitle
- `<SponsorGrid sponsors={sponsors} limit={8} />` to show subset on home page
- "View All Sponsors" link below grid, linking to /sponsors with arrow indicator

**src/app/page.tsx** (update existing):
- Add `import SponsorsSection from '@/components/home/SponsorsSection'`
- Add `<SponsorsSection />` after the `<QuickLinks />` component in the JSX

**src/lib/navigation.ts** (update existing):
- Add organization page links to navLinks array. Keep navigation flat per research recommendation.
- Add after "About" entry: `{ href: '/board-staff', label: 'Board & Staff' }` and `{ href: '/sponsors', label: 'Sponsors' }`
- NOTE: Do NOT add Code of Conduct to main nav — it's accessible from About page and footer. Adding all 4 org pages would overcrowd nav. Keep it at: Home, Teams, About, Board & Staff, Fees & Events, Spirit Wear, Sponsors, Contact.
- Final nav order: Home, Teams, About, Board & Staff, Fees & Events, Spirit Wear, Sponsors, Contact
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit`. Run `npx next build` to confirm all pages build as static HTML. Verify navigation array has correct link count.</verify>
  <done>Code of Conduct page has accordion sections. Sponsors page shows full grid with CTA. Home page includes sponsors section with limited display. Navigation updated with org page links. All pages build successfully as static HTML.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
