<objective>
Create data layer and reusable components for organization pages.

Purpose: Establish type-safe data structures for board members, sponsors, and code of conduct content, plus shared UI components (Accordion, BoardMemberCard, SponsorCard, SponsorGrid) that pages in Plan 02 will consume.
Output: 3 data files, 4 components, placeholder images for board/sponsors.

  <name>Task 1: Data files for organization, sponsors, and code of conduct</name>
  <files>src/lib/data/organization.ts, src/lib/data/sponsors.ts, src/lib/data/conduct.ts, public/images/board/placeholder.jpg, public/images/sponsors/placeholder.jpg</files>
  <action>
Create three data files following the established pattern from `src/lib/data/teams.ts` and `src/lib/data/home.ts`.

**src/lib/data/organization.ts:**
- Export `BoardMember` interface with: `name: string`, `title: string`, `photoUrl: string`, `bio?: string`
- Export `boardMembers: readonly BoardMember[]` with 5 placeholder board members (President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary, Member at Large) using `/images/board/placeholder.jpg` for all photos
- Export `staff: readonly BoardMember[]` as empty array (organization may not have separate staff; conditional rendering in page handles this)
- Privacy-first: NO email or phone fields per user decision

**src/lib/data/sponsors.ts:**
- Export `Sponsor` interface with: `id: string`, `name: string`, `logoUrl: string`, `description: string`, `websiteUrl?: string`
- Export `sponsors: readonly Sponsor[]` with 6 placeholder sponsors using `/images/sponsors/placeholder.jpg` for logos
- Mix sponsor types: local businesses, sports shops, restaurants — realistic placeholder names and descriptions
- Structure supports easy data replacement per user decision

**src/lib/data/conduct.ts:**
- Export `ConductSection` interface with: `id: string`, `title: string`, `rules: readonly string[]`
- Export `conductSections: readonly ConductSection[]` with 4 sections: Player Code of Conduct, Parent Code of Conduct, Coach Code of Conduct, Spectator Expectations
- Each section: 5-7 concise rules based on common youth baseball organization patterns per research
- Content modeled after JerseyWatch best practices

**Placeholder images:**
- Copy `public/images/hero-placeholder.jpg` to `public/images/board/placeholder.jpg`
- Copy `public/images/hero-placeholder.jpg` to `public/images/sponsors/placeholder.jpg`
- Follow established Phase 4 placeholder image strategy
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm type safety. Verify placeholder images exist at both paths.</verify>
  <done>Three data files export typed interfaces and sample data arrays. Placeholder images exist for board members and sponsors.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Organization UI components (Accordion, BoardMemberCard, SponsorCard, SponsorGrid)</name>
  <files>src/components/organization/Accordion.tsx, src/components/organization/BoardMemberCard.tsx, src/components/organization/SponsorCard.tsx, src/components/organization/SponsorGrid.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create four components in `src/components/organization/`.

**Accordion.tsx** (client component):
- Add `'use client'` directive as first line
- Accept `items: AccordionItem[]` prop where AccordionItem has `id: string`, `title: string`, `content: React.ReactNode`
- Use `useState<string | null>(null)` for single-item expansion (clicking one closes the other)
- Toggle logic: `setOpenId(openId === id ? null : id)`
- Render each item as a bordered card with button header and conditional content
- Use `ChevronDown` from lucide-react with `rotate-180` transform when expanded via clsx
- Add `aria-expanded={isOpen}` on button for accessibility
- Style: `border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-lg`, hover on button `bg-gray-50`, content area `bg-gray-50 border-t-2`
- Transition on chevron icon: `transition-transform duration-200`

**BoardMemberCard.tsx** (server component):
- Follow EXACT same pattern as `src/components/teams/CoachCard.tsx`
- Accept `member: BoardMember` prop (import from `@/lib/data/organization`)
- Same card structure: aspect-square photo with next/image, name as h3, title as subtitle, optional bio
- Same styling: `bg-white rounded-lg border-2 border-gray-200 overflow-hidden hover:border-bombers-yellow hover:shadow-lg transition-all`
- Same image sizing: `width={400} height={400}` with `object-cover`, responsive `sizes` attribute

**SponsorCard.tsx** (server component):
- Accept `sponsor: Sponsor` prop (import from `@/lib/data/sponsors`)
- Card with logo area (`h-24 flex items-center justify-center`), name (h3, centered), description (centered, text-sm)
- Use `next/image` with `object-contain` for logos (NOT object-cover, preserves aspect ratio)
- If `sponsor.websiteUrl` exists, wrap entire card in an `<a>` tag with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Style: `bg-white rounded-lg border-2 border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-bombers-yellow hover:shadow-lg transition-all`

**SponsorGrid.tsx** (server component):
- Accept `sponsors: Sponsor[]` and `limit?: number` props
- If limit provided, slice sponsors array to that count (for home page showing subset)
- Render responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6`
- Map sponsors to SponsorCard components with `key={sponsor.id}`
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm all components compile without errors. Verify Accordion has 'use client' directive and aria-expanded attribute.</verify>
  <done>Four components render correctly: Accordion supports single-item expansion with accessibility, BoardMemberCard matches CoachCard pattern, SponsorCard displays logo/name/description with optional link, SponsorGrid renders responsive grid with optional limit.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- All 3 data files export their interfaces and data arrays
- All 4 components exist in `src/components/organization/`
- Accordion.tsx has `'use client'` directive
- Placeholder images exist at `public/images/board/placeholder.jpg` and `public/images/sponsors/placeholder.jpg`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Data layer and components are ready for page assembly in Plan 02. TypeScript compiles without errors. Components follow established patterns from Phase 4 (CoachCard, data files).
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-organization-pages/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
