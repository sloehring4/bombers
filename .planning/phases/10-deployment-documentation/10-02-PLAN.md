<objective>
Deploy the site to Vercel, configure the custom domain, and add board members as GitHub collaborators. These are human-only actions that require account access and cannot be automated by Claude.

Purpose: The site needs to go live on ofallonbombers.com so families can access it. Board members need GitHub access to maintain content.

Output: Live site at ofallonbombers.com, board members with repository access
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Deploy to Vercel and configure custom domain</name>
  <action>
Follow the "Initial Deployment Setup" section of docs/OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md to:

1. Create a Vercel account (or log in) at vercel.com using your GitHub account
2. Import the bombers GitHub repository as a new Vercel project
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and deploys — verify first deployment succeeds
4. Add custom domain ofallonbombers.com in Vercel project Settings -> Domains
5. Update DNS records at your domain registrar:
   - A record: @ -> 76.76.21.21
   - CNAME: www -> cname.vercel-dns.com
   - IMPORTANT: Save/screenshot existing DNS records before making changes
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify MX or TXT records (email will break)
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5 min - 48 hours)
7. Verify SSL certificate auto-provisions (green lock icon)
8. Add board members as GitHub collaborators (Settings -> Collaborators)
  </action>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Visit https://ofallonbombers.com — site loads with Bombers branding
    2. Visit https://www.ofallonbombers.com — redirects to or loads the site
    3. Verify SSL: green lock icon in browser address bar
    4. Make a test content change via PR to confirm auto-deploy pipeline works
    5. Verify at least one board member can access the repository
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "deployed" when the site is live at ofallonbombers.com, or describe any issues encountered</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. https://ofallonbombers.com loads the site with correct branding
2. SSL certificate is active (green lock icon)
3. A PR merged to main triggers automatic deployment
4. Board members can access the GitHub repository
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Site is live and accessible at ofallonbombers.com
- Auto-deploy pipeline works: merge PR -> site updates within 2-3 minutes
- At least one board member has accepted GitHub collaborator invitation
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-deployment-documentation/10-02-SUMMARY.md`
